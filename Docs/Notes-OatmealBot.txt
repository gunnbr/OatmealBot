To use a BT USB dongle with the Arduino Zero/Feather M0/SAMD21:
https://github.com/bluekitchen/btstack
Which is from:
http://bluekitchen-gmbh.com/
But it doesn't look like USB is very much supported. But maybe it is--it is referenced a few times.

Maybe port https://www.circuitsathome.com/category/mcu/arduino/usb-shield/ to the M0?
The latest version does support some native USB: https://github.com/felis/UHS30

Bluetooth spec:
https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/bluetooth-core-specification

Atmel Studio contains an ASF example of a host vendor USB device. Looks like this is a template
for how a Bluetooth HCI class driver can be written.
Documentation about it is here: http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42336-ASF-USB-Stack-Manual_ApplicationNote_AT09331.pdf

Or port this, which is already for an embedded system and PS3 controller:

New plan:
Run it from the Pi Zero.

From https://medium.com/home-wireless/headless-streaming-video-with-the-raspberry-pi-zero-w-and-raspberry-pi-camera-38bef1968e1
and https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs/wiki/Setup-Guide:-Raspberry-Pi-%7C-MJPEG-Streamer-Install-&-Setup-&-FFMpeg-Recording

To stream video from the Pi: 
mjpg_streamer -i "input_raspicam.so -x 1920 -y 1080" -o 'output_http.so -w ./www'

Then in a browser, go to:
